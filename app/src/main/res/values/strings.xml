        \n\nThis app does not incorporate the research and development chart for cheaper units. If you would like to see
        this functionality please comment on the play store about this.
        \n\nAbout the developer: I am a huge fan of the Axis and Allies series and I personally use this app every time I
        play because I found that cash or using a notepad is tedious. I hope you can get some good use out of this app!
        \n\nAnd remember to bomb the harbor!\n\n</string>
